\chapter{Data Storage and Retrieval} \label{chap:data}
One of the central operations whenever dealing with meshes is the storage and the retrieval of data.
A common approach is to model vertices, edges and the like as separate classes and add data members to them.
{\ViennaGrid} does not follow this approach for two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Reusability}: As soon as a data member is added to any of these classes, the class is refined towards a particular use case. For example, adding a color data member to a triangle class reduces reusability for e.g.~Finite Element methods considerably.
 \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Whenever a data member needs to be added for a particular functionality, one has to carefully extend the existing class layout. Moreover, it is somewhere between hard to impossible to 'just add a data member for the moment' in a productive environment.
 \item \textbf{Efficiency}: A data member that is never used obviously wastes memory. For large numbers of object it might be even advisable to use special containers for data that is relevant for a tiny fraction of all objects only (e.g.~domain boundary flags). Apart from reduced memory footprint, the possibly tighter grouping of data allows for better CPU caching. 
\end{enumerate}
{\ViennaGrid} relies on {\ViennaData} \cite{ViennaData} for the storage of data associated with topological objects.
For full details on the capabilities of {\ViennaData}, please refer to the {\ViennaData} manual.
For the sake of completeness, a brief overview of the basic usage of {\ViennaData} for {\ViennaGrid} is given in the following.

\TIP{A tutorial code can be found in \texttt{examples/tutorial/store\_access\_data.cpp}.}

\section{Handling Data}
{\ViennaData} can be seen in a simplified view as something that behaves like a \lstinline|std::map<KeyType, DataType>| for each object for which data should be stored or retrieved. For a \lstinline|key| object of type \lstinline|KeyType|, \lstinline|data| of type \lstinline|DataType| is stored on an object \lstinline|obj| as
\begin{lstlisting}
 viennadata::access<KeyType, DataType>(key)(obj) = data;
\end{lstlisting}
At some later stage, the data can be conveniently retrieved from the object as
\begin{lstlisting}
 DataType my_data = viennadata::access<KeyType, DataType>(key)(obj);
\end{lstlisting}
One may also erase data stored for the object using
\begin{lstlisting}
 viennadata::erase<KeyType, DataType>(key)(obj);
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Customizations of the Internal Storage Scheme}
It can readily be seen that the free function \lstinline|access()| function mimics the template arguments of a \lstinline|std::map<KeyType, DataType>| and takes the key as argument. In fact, the default internal storage scheme of {\ViennaData} for objects of type \lstinline|ObjectType| is 
\begin{lstlisting}
 std::map<ObjectType const *,
          std::map<KeyType, DataType> >
\end{lstlisting}
which is generated for each triple of \lstinline|KeyType|, \lstinline|DataType| and \lstinline|ObjectType| by the compiler.
Since the tree-based structure is well suited for data that is stored for a small fraction of the total number of objects of the same type, we call it a \emph{sparse} data storage scheme. However, such a nested map is not a good datastructure in many cases and can thus be customized in a rather transparent manner.

For objects that provide integral IDs ranging from $0$ to some number $N$, a storage scheme of the form
\begin{lstlisting}
 std::vector< std::map<KeyType, DataType> >
\end{lstlisting}
for each \lstinline|ObjectType| is more appropriate. Since memory for all objects of the same type is used then, we refer to this scheme as a \emph{dense} data storage scheme. This can be obtained by first using (mind the VIENNAGRID prefix!)
\begin{lstlisting}
 VIENNAGRID_ENABLE_ID_BASED_DATA_ACCESS_FOR_ELEMENT()
\end{lstlisting}
which configures {\ViennaData} to use the integral ID of the element. 
Second, dense storage can then be selectively enabled using one of the macros
\begin{lstlisting}
 VIENNADATA_ENABLE_DENSE_DATA_STORAGE_FOR_*
\end{lstlisting}
where the star refers to \lstinline|KEY|, \lstinline|DATA|, \lstinline|OBJECT| or a mixture of these. For details consult the {\ViennaData} manual.

\NOTE{In order to use a dense storage scheme, the storage of IDs for the particular $n$-cells must not be disabled, cf.~Section \ref{subsec:ncell-ids}!}

Moreover, the \lstinline|std::map<KeyType, DataType>| type may be too costly due to key comparisons. For example, the comparison of the strings \lstinline|"rather_long_string_1"| and \lstinline|"rather_long_string_2"| is not suitable for high-performance environment. In such cases, {\ViennaData}
can be configured to dispatch based on the key type only, but not based on runtime information. Using the macro
\begin{lstlisting}
 VIENNADATA_ENABLE_TYPE_BASED_KEY_DISPATCH(my_key)
\end{lstlisting}
configures {\ViennaData} to use a type-based dispatch for a key class type \lstinline|my_key|. In this case, the internal data container of {\ViennaData}
changes to either
\begin{lstlisting}
 std::map<ObjectIDType, DataType>
\end{lstlisting}
with \lstinline|ObjectIDType| being either a pointer or an integral ID, or
\begin{lstlisting}
 std::vector< DataType >
\end{lstlisting}
Therefore, {\ViennaData} can be configured with a high granularity in order to accomodate for the individual data access patterns and data densities.

\TIP{For additional features such as default data types as well as \lstinline|move()| and \lstinline|copy()| functions, consult the {\ViennaData} manual.}
